                <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a passionate <strong>horse racing expert</strong>, a wordsmith, and an intrepid explorer of new frontiers. 
                I am your guide on a thrilling journey where the realm of horse racing  collides with imaginative storytelling.</p>
                <p>But my talents don't stop at the racetrack. I'm also have an innate gift for 
                crafting <strong>captivating plots and ingenious ideas.</strong> My commitment to delivering high-quality content 
                on time while tailoring it precisely to meet your needs sets me apart as a true asset to any project.</p>
                <p>Don't just take my word for it; my writing prowess has left a lasting impression on those I've collaborated with. 
                I have the ability to craft compelling content on any topic that is at least a tad close to my heart. In other words,
                I prefer writing stories centered around lgbt+ themes combined with a detective plot, fantasy worlds, or exploration 
                of sci-fi tropes like from Philip K Dick's masterpieces. </p>
                <p>Being a keen gamer, I am thrilled at the prospect of writing a quest or a whole plot for your project. As I have published
                a book and collaborated on an escape room game, I am ready to work on something bigger. Moreover, stories are
                what I enjoy the most about any games as my favorite ones are the Dragon Age saga, Mass Effect saga, and the Witcher saga.
                </p>
                <p>Regarding my copywriting skills, I have been working with a Spanish company VIME. For their clients,
                    I came up with dozens of articles about mobile apps and other tech stuff, AI and video games, lifestyle, and sports.
                    As long as the instructions are clear, I'm capable of delivering quality content revolving about basically anything.
                </p>
                <p>So, whether you're here for the <strong>thrill of the races, seeking captivating narratives, or looking for a talented 
                wordsmith to elevate your project</strong>, you've come to the right place. Let's embark on this exciting journey 
                together! Welcome to my world; I can't wait to share it with you.

                    <h2>Captivating Stories</h2>
                    <p>I published a book in 2022 that was praised for the characters, character development, and dialogues. 
                        I usually focus on LGBT+ stories with hints of humor; however, I can easily modify my style to your needs. 
                        In 2023, a couple of guys approached me with their outdoor game, resembling <strong>an escape room one</strong>. I created 
                        a custom story for the game, loosely based on a legend emanating from a local village. Therefore, 
                        I really can either focus on an elaborate quest for your game or a whole story. It depends on you :) </p>

            <div class="port-cont-card">

                    <h2>Worldbuilding</h2>
                    <p>Concocting a brilliant story? Check. Coming up with lively dialogues? Check. Delivering some rich lore? Check. 
                        I can do all that tailored just for your needs, and as I mentioned above, I do not mind fantasy or sci-fi worlds. 
                        I'm a massive fan of both books and video games as I adore works by Philip K Dick and Kurt Vonnegut, and when it 
                        comes to games, my favorites are Dragon Age, The Witcher, and Mass Effect.</p>
                    <p>Being a linguist, I can prepare a <strong> whole new language</strong> for you if it's your thing!</p>

                        and straightforward notes on characters, their background, motivations, etc. However, providing 
                        you with elaborated character arcs, an overall plot, and descriptive lore of the world the story 
                        is set in would be an enthralling option. Gladly, I will embark on such a journey with you!

                    <p>Maybe you're not interested in the characters and dialogues as you just desire a new world in which 
                        you could place your story. No problem, I can design a stunning new universe with an elaborate 
                        history of conflicts and peaceful times, including details on the original countries and their 
                        culture, and being a linguist, I can devise new languages just for your story!
