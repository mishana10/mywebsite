                <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a passionate <strong>horse racing expert</strong>, a freelancer, and a remote-only working explorer of new 
                    frontiers. I am your guide on a thrilling journey where the realm of horse racing collides with imaginative storytelling.</p>
                <p>As a true master of the <strong>global</strong> horse racing stage, I bring a depth of knowledge that extends
                    far and wide. Whether it's dissecting the heart-pounding races in the UK, USA, or Japan, 
                    my love for the sport knows no bounds. I've dedicated myself to this exhilarating sport, 
                    and I'm excited to share my insights with you.</p>
                <p>I was born in 1994 in the Czech Republic. In 2021, I graduated from English Philology at Ostrava University, upon which I 
                    started working for JazzGS/HRT, writing analyses and reviews daily. Moreover, I have been delivering articles 
                    in Czech about horse racing worldwide and collaborating with Pardubice Racecourse.</p>
                <p>Although I watch Czech racing closely, my favorite racing happens in the United Kingdom. It doesn't matter if it's Flat 
                    or Jump racing, as I love both equally. I primarily care for horses trained by Aidan O'Brien, Roger Varian, Andrew Balding,
                     Charlie Watson, Harry Fry, and Venetia Williams.
                </p>
                <p>Still, I daily inform myself about racing in Ireland, France, Germany, and the US. When writing for JazzGS, I always cared 
                    for Canadian, Australian, and Japanese racing, with an occasional look at racing in Hong Kong, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Italy.
                     I don't mind covering any horse racing-related topic.
                </p>
                <p>Besides analysis and reviews, I also delivered a piece on the future of Czech horse racing to <a href="https://www.thoroughbredracing.com/articles/5733/future-not-bright-czech-republic-and-it-would-be-silly-say-otherwise-special-report-proud-racing-nation/">Thoroughbred Racing Commentary</a>
                    and Nick Godfrey. Currently, I regularly contribute to Past the Wire, where I discuss various topics from <a href="https://pastthewire.com/from-shergar-to-zazou-stories-of-kidnapped-part-2/">famous horse kidnaps</a>
                    to the situation of traditional horse racing meetings.

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Are you looking for somebody capable of analyzing various races? No problem, as I'm experienced in dissecting the 
                        US races, British races, Irish ones, and many more. If you want either a horse-by-horse analysis or several 
                        paragraphs of consecutive text, I am your best bet!</p>
                    <p>For all of my skills, you can verify them with a former Racing Post writer, Steve Dennis.

                    <h2>Reviews</h2>
                    <p>After the race, you need somebody to take your readers through the results, don't you? I can do that; moreover,
                         I will gauge the horse's potential and think of what the runner might be up to next time! It depends 
                         on what you're looking for.</p>
                    <p>All my articles go hand in hand with the best SEO practice.</p>

                    <h2>Stories</h2>
                    <p>Horse racing brings lots of poignant or overall exciting stories. I am great 
                        at finding them, researching everything about them, and building a captivating article to excite your readers! I've already come up with these miniseries: Famous Horse Racing Kidnaps (from Shergar to Zazou), <a href="https://pastthewire.com/what-makes-a-racing-event-a-traditional-one/"> What Makes
                        A Big Meeting a Traditional One</a> (comparing Royal Ascot to the Breeders' Cup). I'm also working on Frankie's Fanfare
                        for Past the Wire.

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>I know exactly where to look to pinpoint the winner of a race. Of course, I cannot pick every single one, but my 
                        success rate is about 30%, which I take pride in. I either recommend to your readers what horse they should 
                        bet on or write an overall preview of the race while adhering to the best SEO practices.

                    <h2>Reviews</h2>
                    <p>I will look at the result in the way you desire. I can focus on whatever you want me to, either just the winner, the 
                        first three finishers, or even the history of the race. Also, I can deliver information-packed articles, covering 
                        the results of the whole afternoon or even focusing on the most prominent races that were run on that very day.</p>

                    <h2>Stories</h2>
                    <p>As I've mentioned, I have written stories on kidnapped horses, about the Japanese and European Road to the Kentucky Derby,
                         or about what makes a big meeting a traditional one. Just name a topic, or let me come up with a completely original one.
                          I even wrote my master's thesis about horse racing, so I know what I am doing.</p>
